## [W3C CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/)
The style.css file was tested for validation to ensure there were no CSS syntax errors in the project.

The [direct input test](https://github.com/SteveKennyUK/pooch_pals/blob/testing/static/images/testing/css-val.JPG) of the style.css file returned no errors so the project syntax is good.

## [JS Hint](https://jshint.com/)
JavaScript files were tested throughout the project to detect any errors and potential problems in JavaScript code.

The [email.js](https://github.com/SteveKennyUK/pooch_pals/blob/testing/static/images/testing/js-val-2.JPG) and [script.js](https://github.com/SteveKennyUK/pooch_pals/blob/testing/static/images/testing/js-val-1.JPG) scripts were clear of any warnings and only referenced a couple of variables that were called in HTML files.


## [PEP8 Online](http://pep8online.com/)
The app.py file was tested regularly throughout the project to check for any errors and to ensure that the Python code was PEP8 compliant.
[The PEP8 online check](https://github.com/SteveKennyUK/pooch_pals/blob/testing/static/images/testing/pep8-val.JPG) confirms that the code meets all requirements
