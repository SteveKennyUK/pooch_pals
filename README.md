# Pooch Pals
  
 
This website has been created for my Data Centric Development Milestone 3 project, the third project on the [Code Institute Diploma in Software Development](https://codeinstitute.net/) course.

This project is a full-stack site that focuses on a particular domain and its dataset. The aim is to allow users to share their own data and have convenient access to data provided by other users of the site.  

Interest in dog ownership has increased since the start of the COVID pandemic, with people spending more time at home. 'Pooch Pals' aims to meet the needs of dog owners, especially new owners, who would like their dogs to socialise with other dogs. It can also give potential new owners a chance to understand a particular breed before committing to ownership.

The site allows registered users to provide information to create a profile for their dog, which is stored on a MongoDB database. Users can then search for other user profiles to find a good match for their own dogs, plus modify and delete their own information. The ultimate aim is a happy dog, while also helping dog owners to better understand their best friends.


## User Experience (UX)
---
This application will follow the principles of User Centred Design (UCD), which will focus on placing users at the centre of the design and development process.
 
This site has two principal user goals to consider.

 1.  **Site/Business Owners** - for the site owners, it is both a labour of love and a business opportunity. They are primarily interested in the wellbeing of dogs and wish to help dog owners connect so that dogs can spend quality time together. The site owners may have their own dogs which could benefit from the platform. They can also use this as an opportunity to create a platform to promote dog-related goods and partner with other dog-related organisations. This will only be possible by firstly growing the site, which will require building a user friendly experience.

 1.  **Site Users** - the main focus of the site will be to provide a platform for dog owners (whether they be long standing, new or potential owners) to find potential playmates for their own dog or help understand what would be required to own a particular breed. Users would require a site that is easy to use but would also want reassurances that their information is safe as the welfare of their dogs is paramount.
The site users can be identified as falling within one of the following three categories -
	 - **User category 1:** Unregistered/logged out user
	 - **User category 2:** Registered/logged in user
	 - **User category 3:** Admin/site owner user
