                <p>Every dog will have an individual personality but their breed can have a big impact on their
                    behaviour and personality just as much as it affects their looks. This means that a dog will often
                    have some traits that come more naturally to
                    them, for example being really active or wanting to chase smaller animals.
                    These traits are often
                    similar within certain breeds and this is why dogs are categorised into breed groups.
                    Working dogs are likely to need more exercise, for example, and gundogs are likely to want to
                    retrieve.
                </p>
                <p>While every dog is different, as each of the group of dogs were bred to have certain traits, which
                    breed category a dog belongs to can give you a really good idea about what their personality
                    might be like. This could help you to decide which dogs may be suitable to play with your own dog.
                    Similarly, if you are thinking of bringing a new dog into your home, research the breeds before
                    choosing one to make sure that youâ€™re fully prepared to meet their needs!
                </p>
                <p>There are seven breed groups recognised here in the UK. These are: gundog, hound, pastoral, terrier,
                    toy, utility and working. Please see below for some information on each of the seven groups plus
                    crossbreeds.
